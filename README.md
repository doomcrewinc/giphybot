# giphybot
bot that can embed images into a discord channel

## Usage:

* ?test - shows a Test passed message
* ?game - change status, only works if you're doomcrewinc
* ?coin - coin flip
* ?img - embeds dogs with bread on their head gif
* ?gif <tag> grabs random gif from giphy that is tagged with <tag>
* ?uptime - shows how long the bot has been up.
  
  
  This is an extremely rough proof of concept, and it works.
